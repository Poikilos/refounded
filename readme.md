# refounded
This project has been in the planning stage for a long time, but may
become an engine that runs JASS2, a language that is usually called
JASS (which is actually the name of the first version of the language).

See the "JASS projects" sections below for more information.

JASS2 could be considered a substandard and deprecated language:
- https://sc2mapster.gamepedia.com/Language_Overview
- https://github.com/fullmetal-a/cjass2lua

However, many full games are written in JASS2, though they are
unfortunately called "maps" due to the way they were used in
Warcraft III's online "Custom Maps" system. Some full games include:
- DoTA "Defense of the Ancients" and many DoTA clones and other tower
  offense games.
  - DoTA led to DoTA 2 and League of Legends.
- Hardcore/survival games (games with detailed gameplay and character
  and world attributes) such as:
  - [Bug Evolution](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/4043/)
  - [Ice Troll Tribe Wars](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/19469/)
  - Real Life (and easier versions such as [Real Life [for Morons]](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/1252/)
  - [Spellcraft](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/487/)
- Hero arena games such as:
  - [Angel Arena X](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/8346/)
  - [MonstAr.Arena](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/139667/)
- OpenRPG and other large RPGs such as:
  - [Fantasy Life](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/91725/)
  - [Mystica ORPG](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/7577/)
  - [Legends Open RPG](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/130439/)
  - [Ragnarok RPG](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/80733/)
- Single-goal "party games" such as:
  - Assassins
  - [Pyramid Escape](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/165011/) (and other
    "Escape" games)
  - [Kodo Tag](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/103272/)
  - [Missile War](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/58603/)
  - Wolves vs Sheep (and other "vs Sheep" games)
  - [Vampirism](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/51266/)
- Tower Defense (and various variations, which seem to have spawned or
  popularized the tower defense genre itself).
- Many clone games, and others:

## JASS projects with license issues
(These projects have licenses that differ from MIT, so changing
this project to match a different license may be the best way forward.)

### C++
- JASS Tools (sourceforge project)
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/jass/ is a project that contains some
  "tools for parsing and analyzing the JASS scripting language, which
  used for scripting Maps and AI files in Blizzard Entertainment's (R)
  Warcraft III (R)," notably:
  - pjass (BSD 2-Clause)
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/jass/files/a%20pjass/
    "currently the best JASS syntax checker" according to
    http://jass.sourceforge.net/ (October 26, 2005).
    "To test this program:
    `pjass common.j common.ai Blizzard.j`" And yet, pjass is also
    below.

  - This could be ported to Python and use PLY (Python Lex-Yacc).
  - translations: pjass-chs

(These projects may be too far from the design goals to become
dependencies.)
- cjass2lua
  - This translator does not allow inheritance, classes, structures,
    scopes, modules, preprocessor directives, cJass `for` loops, or
    macros ("Macroses are translated into global variables" [sic]).
    Also note that Lua array indices start at 1.
